Arizona Water Science Center gravity processing scripts

* A10_parse.py - creates a tab-separated file with relevant information from a specified directory of project.txt files.
* A10_plot.py - creates figures, one per station, showing gravity change over time, using a file created using A10_parse.py.
* A10_summarize.py - creates a summary of dates, setup height, g, scatter, and sets collected and processed. Outputs one file per station, intended for inclusion in a field binder.
* update_sb_A10_archive.py - synchronizes online ScienceBase gravity archive with the Gravity Data Archive maintained at the Arizona Water Science Center
